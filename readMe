# Overview

WHAT:
The software I made is a D&D battle tracker for those who are acting as the dungeon master.
WHY:
The purpose of this program was to help make easier the tracking of a battle in the D&D game. There are many small attributes that can be hard to remember, instead of havin them 
    all over the place, this program will keep all of those things in the same place and easy to access.

TOOLS:
I used Visual studio code for my Environment with the codeRunner and C/C++ extensions
{Describe the programming language that you used and any libraries.}
I used C++ language for this program with the string and math libraries imported so that
    I can properly name entities as well as use the random command for rolling dice.
